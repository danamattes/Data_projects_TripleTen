# Data Science Projects Through TripleTen


1) Video Game Sales - Sales forecast

The objective of this project is to assist the ICE store, an online video game store that sales worldwide, performing a comprehensive analysis of their video game sales data in order to prepare their marketing strategy for year 2017. They are particularly interested in spotting potential top selling games, as well as the public's preferred genre and platforms, and whether these preferences change according to the client's geographic location. 

Skills Demonstrated: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, profile creation, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation


2) OilyGiant - Selecting the region with the highest profit margin

OilyGiant is looking for a the best location for a new well. For this matter, three areas have been pre-selected. The information of these areas will be analyzed in order to identify the area with the biggest amount of reserves, as well as perform a risk assessment. 

Skills Demonstrated: Linear regression, data interpretation, bootstrapping, profit maximization, and risk assessment


3) Rusty Bargain - Estimating Market Value of Used Cars

Rusty Bargain is developing an app where you can quickly find out the market value of your car. We were tasked to create a machine learning model that predicts this information. 

Skills Demonstrated: Exploratory data analysis, data encoding and scaling, gradient boosting algorithms (CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBRegressor), wall time optimization, and model performance analysis


4) Forecasting Telecom Customer Retention and Churn

Objective: To develop a machine learning model for the telecom operator Interconnect that uses data of customers' contract details, internet usage, phone usage, and demographic information to predict customer churn, thereby allowing Interconnect to offer promotional codes and special plan options to customers who are expected to leave.

Skills Demonstrated: Data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis
